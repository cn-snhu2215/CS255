# CS255

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that wanted to modernize their software to address some security issues. In this project I evaluated their software for potential problems and implemented fixes such as generating a security certificate, using a checksum verification, adding a REST API controller to handle client-server communication, etc. I found the vulnerability assessment helpful in determining that I hadn't added any new vulnerabilities to the application by using additional libraries.
